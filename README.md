### A Stocks Comparison analysis between Tesla and other cars Companies(Ford & GM)
This project is meant to cap off on the use of pandas, which mainly dealt with learning the libraries that we use in stocks data analysis.
I'll be analyzing stock data related to a few car companies i.e Tesla, Ford and GM motors, from Jan 1 2012 to Jan 1 2017.
